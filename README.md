# A sample React App to get hands dirty

I did this sample project to revise the concepts of React for my upcoming interview.
It has been a while since I coded in Javascript and React as I was pursuing 
masters and was busy with class projects. 

Thanks to Mosh. 
You are a <h4>great teacher.</h4>

This project is not my creation. I followed reactjs tutorial from Mosh on youtube.
